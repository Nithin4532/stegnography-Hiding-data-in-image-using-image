PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

Steganography, the art of concealing information within other non-secret data, finds its modern application in digital media like images. This project presents a Steganography Tool with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using Python's Tkinter library and PIL (Python Imaging Library, now known as Pillow) for image manipulation. The tool allows users to encode textual messages into images and subsequently decode hidden messages from encoded images.
Project Overview
The Steganography Tool provides a straightforward interface enabling users to perform two primary operations: Encoding and Decoding.
Encoding:
1.	Image Selection: Users begin by selecting an image file (in formats like PNG, JPEG, or JPG) to serve as the carrier for their hidden message.
2.	Text Entry: They then input the text message they wish to conceal within the selected image.
3.	Encoding Process: The tool processes the image and embeds the text message into it using LSB (Least Significant Bit) embedding technique. This technique alters the least significant bits of selected pixels in the image to encode the binary representation of each character in the text message.
4.	Output: Once encoded, the tool saves the modified image with the hidden message, ready for distribution or further analysis.
Decoding:
1.	Image Selection: Users choose an encoded image containing a hidden message.
2.	Decoding Process: The tool extracts and decodes the hidden message from the image by analyzing the LSBs of pixel values. It reconstructs the binary data and converts it back into readable text.
3.	Display: The extracted message is displayed on the GUI, allowing users to view the concealed information.
Technical Implementation
•	GUI Design: Implemented using Tkinter, Python's standard GUI library, providing buttons and entry fields for user interaction. The GUI ensures intuitive navigation between encoding and decoding functionalities.
•	Image Processing: PIL (Pillow) library handles image operations, including loading, resizing, embedding, and extracting data from images.
•	Data Embedding: The tool uses LSB embedding, altering the least significant bits of pixel values in the carrier image. This method ensures minimal visual impact on the image while effectively hiding the data.
•	User Feedback: Utilizes message boxes from Tkinter to provide user feedback, such as error messages for incorrect operations or success notifications upon completing encoding or decoding.
